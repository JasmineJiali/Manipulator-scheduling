This folder contains files of solving the manipulator scheduling problem where there is only one kind of processing method.

To solve the optimal scheduling of 8 products A. The process path and time of product A are
A: In → Pre (60s) → Buffer → P1 (240s) → P2 (300s) → P3 (360s) → P4 (390s) → P5 (270s) → P6 (330s) → Buffer → Post (100s) → Out
