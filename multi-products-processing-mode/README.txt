#multi-products-processing-mode

This folder contains files of solving manipulator scheduling problem where there are two different kinds of products which need different 
processing methods.

The optimal scheduling of 4 products C and 4 products D is processed. The process path and time of product C and D are respectively
C: In → Pre (60s) → Buffer → P1 (180s) → P3 (360s) → P5 (200s) → P6（330s）→ Buffer → Post (100s) → Out
D: In → Pre (60s) → Buffer → P1 (180s) → P2 (300s) → P4 (390s) → P5 (200s) → Buffer → Post (100s) → Out
